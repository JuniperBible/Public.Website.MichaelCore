## I. The Divine Play

All beings act upon a stage set by the Creator. None writes the script, and none sees its end. What seems tragedy or folly within the scene may be comedy in eternity. Judgment belongs only to the Author, whose justice and mercy are one.

## II. The Refining Fire

This vale of tears is not punishment but process. Suffering is the refiner’s fire through which the imperfect form learns the contour of perfection. From corruption arises wisdom; from decay, renewal. The world is not fallen matter; it is molten meaning.

## III. The Universal Triumph of Good

Evil is not equal to good but parasitic upon it. Sin’s persistence proves only that the Good is generous enough to allow freedom. Every act of disobedience is already folded into redemption. The final harmony will reveal that all discord served the symphony.

## IV. The Triune Self

Man bears the imprint of the divine Trinity:

- The Mind, echo of the Father’s will.  
- The Body, expression of the Son’s incarnation.  
- The Soul, breath of the Spirit uniting the two.

Together they mirror God’s creative communion, finite reflections of infinite relationship.

## V. The Cosmic Ascent

Creation is not static but exploratory. Stars, atoms, consciousness, and civilizations all participate in an unfolding revelation. Whether the cosmos teems with other minds or lies silent, both testify to divine abundance. The universe itself is God’s unfinished poem.

## VI. The Freedom of the Image

Free will is the signature of divine likeness. The Creator foresaw rebellion and wove it into the plan of perfection, allowing humanity to taste the knowledge of good and evil so that one day it might choose the Good freely, wholly, and joyfully as co-creators within His eternal design.
