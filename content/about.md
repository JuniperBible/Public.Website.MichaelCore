## Hey, I'm Justin

I (Justin) am a Technologist and Cybersecurity Aficionado. I have had the blessing to work and play in the Information Technology and Information Security Industry for 10+ years, and enjoyed almost every minute of it.

I spend my days advising organizations on how to keep their most valuable data safe, leading CMMC assessments, and helping defense contractors navigate a labyrinth of acronyms that could make even a seasoned bureaucrat sweat. By night and on weekends, you will usually find me behind a camera, tinkering with something I probably just voided a warranty on, or tumbling down a rabbit hole of curiosity that started with a simple question like “How does that work?” and ended three hours later with a new side project.

## What I Do

My path has taken me through the trenches of managed security services, where I built and led security teams from scratch, into strategic consulting roles focused on risk, compliance, and making the complex understandable. I have helped healthcare organizations reach HITRUST certification, guided defense contractors through CMMC readiness, and supported businesses across industries in strengthening their security posture.

Along the way, I collected a handful of certifications including CISSP, OSCP, GXPN, CISM, LCCA and more than a dozen others. I do not take them too seriously; the real value has always been the learning itself. Every time I think I am getting a handle on the field, it reveals a new, unexplored continent of ideas; and it keeps me humble.

I earned a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a focus on Security from Western Governors University, and I am currently pursuing my MBA at Boston University. My learning does not stop at technology either. I wander freely through interests like horology (yes, clocks), psychology, horticulture, mythology, physics, philosophy, chemistry, and biology. Curiosity rules the kingdom.

## Beyond Security

When I am not threat modeling or untangling compliance frameworks, you will probably find me doing something equally nerdy but with better lighting.

**Behind the lens:** Photography and videography give me a way to slow the world down. Sometimes I even manage to make it hold still long enough to get the shot.

**Building things:** A home lab running Kubernetes? Absolutely. NixOS configs that grow into sprawling ecosystems? Guilty. A side project in Go or Python because I had a thought at 1 a.m.? That happens more often than it should.

**Exploring ideas:** I have never met a topic I did not want to poke at. Blockchain, offensive security, esoteric math, strange philosophical side quests. All fair game.

## Why "Focus with Justin"?

The name plays on more than photography. It is also a gentle nod to everyone who grew up hearing focus as if it were a moral directive. Focus with Justin is meant to soften that command into an invitation. It is about approaching things with intention, not tension. Whether I am knee deep in a security assessment, lining up a shot, or learning something new, I try to create a space where attention feels inviting rather than demanded; like a companion instead of a critic.

## Let’s Connect

Beyond my occasional delusions of grandeur and technology prowess; I appreciate good company, good wine, good scotch, good food, and good conversation with curious minds.
