## LITURGY OF THE WORD

### First Reading  
**Song of Songs 2:8–10, 14, 16a; 8:6–7a**  
(Lectionary for Mass, Ritual Masses 801–7)

*A reading from the Song of Songs.*

Hark! my lover—here he comes,  
springing across the mountains,  
leaping across the hills.  
My lover is like a gazelle or a young stag.

Here he stands behind our wall,  
gazing through the windows,  
peering through the lattices.

My lover speaks; he says to me,  
“Arise, my beloved, my dove, my beautiful one, and come!

“O my dove in the clefts of the rock,  
in the secret recesses of the cliff,  
let me see you, let me hear your voice,  
for your voice is sweet, and you are lovely.”

My lover belongs to me and I to him.

He says to me:  
“Set me as a seal on your heart,  
as a seal on your arm;  
for stern as death is love,  
relentless as the nether world is devotion;  
its flames are a blazing fire.  
Deep waters cannot quench love,  
nor floods sweep it away!”

The word of the Lord.  
R. Thanks be to God.

### Responsorial Psalm  
**Psalm 128**  
(Lectionary for Mass 803–5)

R. Blessed are those who fear the Lord.

Blessed are all who fear the Lord and walk in his ways!  
By the labor of your hands you shall eat;  
you will be blessed and prosper.  
R. Blessed are those who fear the Lord.

Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine in the heart of your house;  
your children like shoots of the olive, around your table.  
R. Blessed are those who fear the Lord.

Indeed thus shall be blessed the man who fears the Lord.  
May the Lord bless you from Zion all the days of your life!  
May you see your children’s children.  
R. Blessed are those who fear the Lord.

### Second Reading  
**1 Peter 3:1–9**  
(Lectionary for Mass 802–10)

*A reading from the first Letter of Saint Peter.*

Beloved:

You wives should be subordinate to your husbands so that,  
even if some disobey the word,  
they may be won over without a word by their wives’ conduct  
when they observe your reverent and chaste behavior.

Your adornment should not be an external one:  
braiding the hair, wearing gold jewelry, or dressing in fine clothes,  
but rather the hidden character of the heart,  
expressed in the imperishable beauty of a gentle and calm disposition,  
which is precious in the sight of God.

For this is also how the holy women who hoped in God  
once used to adorn themselves and were subordinate to their husbands;  
thus Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him “lord.”  
You are her children when you do what is good and fear no intimidation.

Likewise, you husbands should live with your wives in understanding,  
showing honor to the weaker female sex,  
since you are joint heirs of the gift of life,  
so that your prayers may not be hindered.

The word of the Lord.  
R. Thanks be to God.

### Gospel Acclamation  
(Lectionary for Mass 804)

R. Alleluia, alleluia.  
God is love.  
Let us love one another, as God has loved us.  
R. Alleluia.

---

### Gospel  
**John 15:12–16**  
(Lectionary for Mass 805–9)

The Lord be with you.  
R. And with your spirit.

A reading from the holy Gospel according to John.  
R. Glory to you, O Lord.

Jesus said to his disciples:

“This is my commandment: love one another as I love you.  
No one has greater love than this, to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.

You are my friends if you do what I command you.  
I no longer call you slaves, because a slave does not know what his master is doing.  
I have called you friends, because I have told you everything I have heard from my Father.

It was not you who chose me, but I who chose you and appointed you  
to go and bear fruit that will remain,  
so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you.”

The Gospel of the Lord.  
R. Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.
