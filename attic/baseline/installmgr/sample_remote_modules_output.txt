Although Install Manager provides a convenient way for installing
and upgrading SWORD components, it also uses a systematic method
for accessing sites which gives packet sniffers a target to lock
into for singling out users. 


IF YOU LIVE IN A PERSECUTED COUNTRY AND DO NOT WISH TO RISK DETECTION,
YOU SHOULD *NOT* USE INSTALL MANAGER'S REMOTE SOURCE FEATURES.


Also, Remote Sources other than CrossWire may contain less than
quality modules, modules with unorthodox content, or even modules
which are not legitimately distributable.  Many repositories
contain wonderfully useful content.  These repositories simply
are not reviewed or maintained by CrossWire and CrossWire
cannot be held responsible for their content. CAVEAT EMPTOR.


If you understand this and are willing to enable remote source features
then type yes at the prompt

enable? [no]
