# Magellan submodule placeholder
# This directory previously held the magellan submodule (git@github.com:FocuswithJustin/magellan.git).
# It was temporarily removed from .gitmodules because the repo is private and
# Cloudflare Pages cannot clone it during CI builds.
#
# To restore:
#   1. Make the magellan repo public, OR configure CI with a deploy key
#   2. Re-add the submodule:
#      git submodule add -b development https://github.com/FocuswithJustin/magellan.git tools/magellan
#   3. Remove this .gitkeep file
