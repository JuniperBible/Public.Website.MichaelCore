// LXX (Septuagint) versification system.
// Used for Greek Old Testament translations.
// Key differences from KJV:
// - Different book order (follows Greek tradition)
// - Additional books not in Hebrew canon
// - Different chapter/verse divisions (especially Jeremiah, Psalms)
// - Some books split differently (e.g., 1-4 Kingdoms vs 1-2 Samuel + 1-2 Kings)
