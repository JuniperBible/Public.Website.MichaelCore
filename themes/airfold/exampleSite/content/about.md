## About This Demo

This is a demonstration of the AirFold theme for Hugo. The theme features:

- **Paper Aesthetic**: Wavy borders and offset shadows create a handwritten notebook feel
- **Dark Mode**: Full support with system preference detection
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Modern utility-first CSS with custom theme tokens
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach for all screen sizes
- **SEO Ready**: Meta tags, Open Graph, Twitter Cards, and JSON-LD

## The Design Philosophy

AirFold embraces imperfection. The slightly wavy borders and hand-drawn aesthetic remind us that behind every website is a human creator. It's designed to feel personal and approachable.
